# Describing Performance 
Once you have described the load on your system, you can investigate what happens when the load increases. You can look at it in two ways: 
	•When you increase a load parameter and keep the system resources (CPU, mem‐ ory, network bandwidth, etc.) unchanged, how is the performance of your system affected?
	• When you increase a load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resources if you want to keep performance unchange
