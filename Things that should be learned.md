# SYSTEM DESIGN   

# PART 1 — THEORETICAL (Conceptual Depth Layer)


## 1️ Distributed Systems Theory

- [ ] CAP theorem
    
- [ ] Consistency models (strong, eventual, causal)
    
- [ ] Quorum reads/writes
    
- [ ] Consensus basics (Raft idea level)
    
- [ ] Replication strategies
    
- [ ] Partition tolerance
    
- [ ] Exactly-once vs at-least-once
    
- [ ] Idempotency

## 2️ Storage Engine Internals

- [ ] B+ Trees
    
- [ ] LSM Trees
    
- [ ] Write amplification
    
- [ ] Compaction
    
- [ ] Bloom filters
    
- [ ] Row vs columnar storage
    
- [ ] Compression & encoding
    
- [ ] Index structures
    

This helps you answer:

> Why is OLTP different from OLAP storage?


## 3️ Database Theory
- [ ] ACID vs BASE
    
- [ ] Isolation levels
    
- [ ] Normalization vs denormalization
    
- [ ] Star vs snowflake schema
    
- [ ] Slowly changing dimensions
    
- [ ] Query planning
    
- [ ] Cost-based optimization
    
## 4️ Scalability & Performance Theory

- [ ] Throughput vs latency
    
- [ ] Horizontal vs vertical scaling
    
- [ ] Load balancing strategies
    
- [ ] Data skew
    
- [ ] Backpressure
    
- [ ] Hot partitions
    
- [ ] Caching theory
    

This is architecture thinking.

## 5️ System Design Thinking

- [ ] Bottleneck identification
    
- [ ] Failure scenarios
    
- [ ] Trade-off articulation
    
- [ ] Cost analysis
    
- [ ] Availability vs consistency trade-offs
    

This is what differentiates average vs elite candidates.

# PART 2 — PRACTICAL (Execution Layer)

## 1️ SQL Mastery (Highest Priority)

- [ ] Complex joins
    
- [ ] Window functions
    
- [ ] CTEs
    
- [ ] Query optimization
    
- [ ] Index usage
    
- [ ] Partitioning
    

Data engineering interviews heavily test this

## 2️ Spark (Batch Processing)

- RDD vs DataFrame
    
- DAG execution
    
- Shuffle
    
- Partitioning
    
- Lazy evaluation
    
- Join strategies
    

You must know what causes performance issues.

## 3️ Kafka (Streaming)

- [ ] Topics
    
- [ ] Partitions
    
- [ ] Consumer groups
    
- [ ] Offset management
    
- [ ] Rebalancing
    
- [ ] Retention policies

## 4️ Data Warehousing Tools

- [ ] ETL vs ELT
    
- [ ] Data lake vs warehouse
    
- [ ] Parquet/ORC
    
- [ ] Partition pruning
    
- [ ] Clustering


## 5️ Orchestration

- [ ] DAG scheduling
    
- [ ] Airflow concepts
    
- [ ] Backfills
    
- [ ] Retry policies
    
- [ ] Monitoring

## 6️ Cloud Basics

- [ ] Object storage
    
- [ ] IAM
    
- [ ] Managed Kafka
    
- [ ] Managed Spark
    
- [ ] Cost optimization
